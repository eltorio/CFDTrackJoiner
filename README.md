# CFDTrackJoiner
Technology demonstrator for joining GPX, FIT and IGC files for the new french "CFD Marche et Vol"

# Limitations
This is a pre-alpha version sort of a technology demonstrator.

Today it is only tested with FIT files coming from a Garmin® Fenix 6X and IGC files coming from SkyBean® SkyDrop variometer and GPX exported from Strava®.

Currently if an interval overlap another the join is not processed.
